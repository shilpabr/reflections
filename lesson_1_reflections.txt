All these years I have used clearcase for version control and beyond compare
for all the diff I ever wanted to check. Beyond compare is a well made tool, differences are highlighted. 

Diff from command line is not all that user friendly but anyday better
than checking manually.

Choosing when to commit.
Choosing when to commit is better over saving versions automatically. Because the version tree may grow to an enormous size and may make the diff between versions very tedious.
Because versions created automatically can turn out to be useless.
I was wondering if there was a way to save the work automatically without creating a version. Like how it works in wordpress?
